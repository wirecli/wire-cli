# wire-cli

wire-cli is a CLI (Command-Line Interface) tool designed to provide ease of use and efficiency for ProcessWire developers. With wire-cli, you can automate common tasks, manage ProcessWire projects effortlessly, and enhance your development workflow.

## Features

- Create new ProcessWire projects
- Serve ProcessWire via built-in PHP webserver
- Perform database backup and restoration
- Manage fields, templates, roles, users, and modules
- Generate boilerplate modules
- Check for core upgrades
- And more...

wire-cli is based on the defunct wireshell, built using the [Symfony Console](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console.html) Component, offering a powerful and intuitive command-line interface for interacting with ProcessWire projects and adding new commands. It is compatible with PHP 8.1.

Please note that wire-cli and another tool called [rockshell](https://github.com/baumrock/rockshell) share similar goals and functionality. In the future, the features of wire-cli and rockshell will be merged to provide a unified and comprehensive CLI tool for ProcessWire developers.
